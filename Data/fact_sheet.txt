1. Organisation Overview
GÉANT is the fundamental infrastructure for European digital research. It acts as both a physical network operator and a central coordination hub for National Research and Education Networks (NRENs).


Legal Name: GÉANT Association

Legal Form: Non-profit association under Dutch law.

Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands (with significant operations in Cambridge, UK).

Governance: Owned and governed by its member NRENs via a General Assembly.

D9.5 – Open Source and Licence Support Report
• Results from the Open Source & licensing support activity, including guides, templates, training, certification support and automation/governance work.


GN5-IC1 (Ongoing to May 2026): Focuses specifically on intercontinental connectivity and global R&E partnerships.

Funding Model: A hybrid of EC grants (Horizon Europe) and NREN membership contributions.

3. Network Infrastructure
The GÉANT network is the world’s most advanced research network, providing high-bandwidth, low-latency paths for scientific data.

Capacity: Up to 12 Tbps backbone capacity on specific routes.

Performance: 99.999% average availability; designed for "Big Science" (Physics, Astronomy, Genomics).

Traffic Volume: Carries over 9 Petabytes of data per day.

Global Connectivity: Links Europe to the US, Latin America (BELLA), Africa (AfricaConnect), and Asia-Pacific.

4. National Research and Education Networks (NRENs)
NRENs are specialized entities that provide national connectivity to universities and research institutes. GÉANT does not replace NRENs; it interconnects them.
