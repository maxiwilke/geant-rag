1. Organisation Overview
GÉANT is the fundamental infrastructure for European digital research. It acts as both a physical network operator and a central coordination hub for National Research and Education Networks (NRENs).


Legal Name: GÉANT Association

Legal Form: Non-profit association under Dutch law.

Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands (with significant operations in Cambridge, UK).

Governance: Owned and governed by its member NRENs via a General Assembly.

Operational Scope: Pan-European backbone with extensive global interconnections (Intercontinental connectivity).

2. Strategic Projects & Funding
GÉANT operates under a series of multi-year projects co-funded by the European Commission (Horizon Europe).

GN5-1 (Completed Dec 2024): Focused on network capacity and the "Above-the-Net" service portfolio.

GN5-2 (Current: Jan 2025 – 2027): The current flagship project aimed at Terabit-scale capacity, quantum-safe networking, and AI integration in network operations.

GN5-IC1 (Ongoing to May 2026): Focuses specifically on intercontinental connectivity and global R&E partnerships.

Funding Model: A hybrid of EC grants (Horizon Europe) and NREN membership contributions.

3. Network Infrastructure
The GÉANT network is the world’s most advanced research network, providing high-bandwidth, low-latency paths for scientific data.

Capacity: Up to 12 Tbps backbone capacity on specific routes.

Performance: 99.999% average availability; designed for "Big Science" (Physics, Astronomy, Genomics).

Traffic Volume: Carries over 9 Petabytes of data per day.

Global Connectivity: Links Europe to the US, Latin America (BELLA), Africa (AfricaConnect), and Asia-Pacific.

4. National Research and Education Networks (NRENs)
NRENs are specialized entities that provide national connectivity to universities and research institutes. GÉANT does not replace NRENs; it interconnects them.

5. Core Service Portfolio
5.1 Trust & Identity (T&I)
eduroam: Global secure Wi-Fi roaming for academics. Authenticates billions of sessions annually.

eduGAIN: Interfederation service connecting 70+ identity federations, allowing users to use home credentials for thousands of services.

InAcademia: Real-time student/staff status verification for commercial discounts and services.

5.2 Cloud Services (OCRE)
OCRE 2024 Framework: The current framework (active from Feb 2025 to 2030) providing compliant access to commercial cloud services (AWS, Google, Azure) with pre-negotiated volume discounts and data-egress waivers.

5.3 Security
GÉANT Security Days: Annual community event for cybersecurity practitioners.

DDoS Mitigation: Infrastructure-level protection for the European backbone and member NRENs.

6. Research & Innovation Role
GÉANT tests emerging technologies before they hit the commercial market.

Quantum Networking: Testing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and ultra-precise time/frequency transfer.

Fibre Sensing: Using the fiber backbone to detect environmental events (e.g., plane landings, seismic activity).

AI for Networks (AIOps): Using machine learning to predict outages and optimize traffic flow.
