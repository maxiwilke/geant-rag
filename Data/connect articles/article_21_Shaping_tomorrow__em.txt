TITLE: Shaping tomorrow: empowering the next generation with FTP25

The GÉANT Learning and Development Team (GLAD) are helping shape young talent again by providing students and young professionals with a valuable opportunity to enhance their skills through the GÉANT Future Talent Programme (FTP). FTP25 has empowered 12 participants to create a strong narrative for their presentations, and five finalists have been selected to deliver Lightning Talks at TNC25, following training and coaching from Michael Koenka of Koenka and Partners.
“Watching the FTP25 finalists bring their unique spin to concepts in areas such as Network and AI has been inspiring. The FTP continues to be a vital platform that enables the young talent in our community to shine.”

“The Future Talent Programme is more than just an opportunity, it’s a journey of discovery, connection, and growth. It invites you to dive deep into a topic you’re pa
ssionate a
bout and present it to a community of curious, openminded individuals eager to listen, learn, and engage in meaningful dialogue. Guided by an incredible team who are truly exceptional, you’ll gain invaluable insights, refine your presentation skills, and step onto the stage for an exciting five-minute challenge. But this programme is about more than just the spotlight, it’s about the connections you build, the inspiration you share, and the memories you create. If you’re ready to learn, grow, and connect in ways that will stay with you long after, this is your moment. Join in and make it extraordinary!”

“The Future Talent Programme is truly an eyeopening experience. Not only does it teach you how to present your hard work and research to a large audience of genuinely interested professionals, it makes you realise that what you have to say matters and that you can be heard! You gain priceless speaking experience, meet fantastic people, and learn so much about your subject area, all while feeling like a real VIP! I wish I could do it again!”
