TITLE: RENAM supports the advancement of cervical cancer care through technology in Moldova’s National Colposcopy Network

Moldova is making significant strides in the fight against cervical cancer, with the help of innovative technology and strong leadership from Dr. Diana Valuta, Head of the Cervical Screening Coordination Unit at the Research Institute for Mother and Child Health Care. Dr. Valuta’s vision for using digital tools to improve healthcare in Moldova was highlighted at the
RENAM
25th anniversary conference, organised under the auspices of the project ‘EU4Digital: Connecting Research and Education Communities Project (EaPConnect)’ in October 2024. Dr Valuta shared how the country is reshaping its cervical cancer prevention programme.
Cervical cancer, while preventable, remains a serious public health issue worldwide. However, it is the only cancer that can be eliminated from the lives of 21st-century women through two proven methods: HPV vaccination and cervical screening of women aged 25+ years.
Dr. Valuta stated, “Only cervical cancer has a long pre-morbid (pre-cancerous) period, usually seven, 10 or 12 years with a possibility of being diagnosed and treated early. This golden window makes preventive action possible”.
This is especially important in Moldova, where the healthcare system faces challenges such as a shortage of trained professionals and limited access to care in rural areas. To overcome these obstacles, Moldova has implemented several key initiatives. The most significant of these is the launch of the National Colposcopy Network in November 2023. This network connects 12 regional hospitals and clinics to the National Colposcopy Referral Centre in Chisinau. The system enables local healthcare specialists to offer colposcopy services using telemedicine to examine and biopsy abnormal cervical cells, with remote guidance from top experts in the capital.
“Local doctors equipped with video colposcopes can now perform biopsies under the supervision of specialists, reducing the need for patients to travel long distances,” explains Dr. Valuta.
The results of these innovations have been remarkable. Since the network’s launch, the country has seen a significant increase in cervical cytology test coverage, which has doubled, and colposcopy attendance, which has surged to 72%. Furthermore, the treatment of precancerous lesions has tripled, reaching 78%, helping to prevent the progression to cancer. Dr. Valuta also highlights the success of the country’s HPV vaccination programme, which now includes 57% of eligible young people.
A key partner in this effort has been RENAM. The Moldovan NREN’s secure, high-resolution videoconferencing capabilities, based on the BigBlueButton platform, has made it possible to provide real-time support and encourage a proactive approach among specialists in remote areas.
“These digital tools not only improve patient outcomes but also boost the confidence of healthcare workers,” Dr. Valuta notes, emphasising the importance of empowering local clinicians with the resources and knowledge they need.
Looking ahead, Moldova is focused on expanding its digital health efforts further. Plans are already in motion to digitalise other services within cervical screening, such as laboratory services, cytology and histopathology. Dr. Valuta and her team also envision developing an artificial intelligence tool to enhance the analysis of histopathology results.
“While advanced technologies in medical processes often seem as though they’ve been introduced with a ‘magic wand’, I firmly believe that behind this ‘magic’ is a great deal of hard work, numerous processes, and a significant amount of responsibility – all of which are crucial for the success of our efforts” she closes.
Moldova’s use of technology in its healthcare system is a powerful example of how small countries can leverage innovation to tackle public health challenges. By combining cutting-edge digital solutions with a commitment to training and collaboration, Moldova is setting a new standard for cervical cancer prevention and digital health transformation.
