TITLE: In The Field turns 10: a decade of showcasing the global impact of NRENs

This year marks the 10th anniversary of
In The Field
, a storytelling project that has grown into a rich and widely valued resource for the global National Research and Education Network (NREN) community.
W
hile the project has been led by the
AARNet
(Australia’s NREN) Marketing and Communications team since its launch in 2015,
In The Field
has always been a truly collaborative effort—shaped and sustained by the contributions of NRENs around the world. Special thanks go to NORDUnet, who have provided dedicated editorial support from the beginning, and to GÉANT, who played a key role in the early years and have continued to support the project by sharing stories through their community channels. Many other NRENs have contributed and shared stories throughout its history, making this a genuine community success.
“
In The Field
is a powerful reflection of the NREN community’s collective impact. It brings our purpose to life through the voices of researchers, educators and network experts who are driving change. We’re proud to have led this initiative and to celebrate the role collaboration has played in its success,” said Chris Hancock AM, CEO of AARNet.
“This project has connected and inspired the global NREN community. It’s shown how our individual stories, when brought together, tell a compelling narrative about the value of research and education networks. I highly value the way In The Field resonates with the collaborative efforts of the R&E community and look forward to following the development of this important resource,” said Valter Nordh, CEO of NORDUnet.
Over the past decade,
In The Field
has published more than 485 stories from 109 NRENs, spanning every continent. These stories highlight the diverse ways NRENs support and empower the research and education sector—from enabling breakthroughs in climate science and quantum computing to connecting students in remote communities, improving telehealth services, and driving innovation in AI, agriculture, and astronomy. They also showcase how NRENs play a vital role in helping communities prepare for and respond to extreme weather events through timely data sharing, resilient infrastructure, and collaborative research.
What sets
In The Field
apart is its focus on outcomes. The stories go beyond the technology to show what’s possible when researchers, educators, and institutions are supported by high-performance infrastructure and trusted collaborations. In doing so,
In The Field
has become a powerful tool not only for community storytelling but also for stakeholder engagement. It provides real-world examples that help funders, policy makers, and partners understand the value of the work we do.
The project’s success is a testament to the spirit of collaboration that defines our global community. AARNet continues to coordinate and maintain the platform, but its strength lies in the diversity of voices and experiences it brings together.
To mark this milestone, the website has recently been refreshed with an updated look and feel, making it even easier to explore and share stories.
As
In The Field
enters its second decade, we invite you to revisit the site, contribute your stories, and help us continue celebrating the work of NRENs and the communities they serve.
I’m proud to have led this project and seen it grow into what it is today.
