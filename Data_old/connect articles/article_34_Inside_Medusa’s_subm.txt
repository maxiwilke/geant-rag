TITLE: Inside Medusa’s submarine cable project: a bridge between Africa and Europe

In the summer of 2024, GÉANT and Medusa Submarine Cable System signed a contract that will deliver high-capacity connectivity to interconnect the member NRENs of ASREN in North Africa with Europe for the next 25 years. With funding from the European Union channelled via the European Investment Bank, this agreement marks the first of the European Union’s Global Gateway initiatives to deliver R&E connectivity, ensuring long-term security of supply.
The implementation of the Medusa submarine cable process is underway and the first links connecting the Moroccan NREN, MARWAN, and the Tunisian NREN, RNU, to each other and to Europe will go live at the end of 2025, with links for ARN in Algeria and ENSTINET in Egypt to follow in 2026.
With implementation being overseen as part of the EU-funded EUMEDplus project, Medusa will make a vital contribution to the long-term sustainability of North African NRENs, a key EUMEDplus objective.

CONNECT caught up with Medusa CEO, Norman Albi, to learn more about the new cable system and his perspective on working with the R&E networking community.
Medusa is part of the AFR-IX Telecom that delivers internet and data services in Africa but has not to date been a cable operator. What led you to make the decision to deploy your own submarine cable system?
At AFR-IX, we have always been committed to providing high-quality connectivity across Africa. However, we recognized that a significant challenge remained: the lack of a fully interconnected, carrier-neutral submarine cable system serving the Mediterranean region that connects all countries. The opportunity to design and implement a system tailored to the needs of carriers, internet service providers (ISPs), and research and education networks was a natural step forward.
By deploying Medusa, we ensure that we are not only relying on existing infrastructure but also actively shaping the future of connectivity in the region. Our decision was driven by the need to improve long-term network capacity, security, and accessibility for underserved areas. We saw a clear opportunity to create a more open and competitive environment for connectivity in North Africa and Southern Europe, ensuring that all stakeholders benefit from a high-performance, and scalable solution. Additionally, with support from key institutions such as the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, the vision of creating a robust and inclusive Mediterranean cable system became a feasible reality.
To date, there has never been a submarine cable system that lands in all North African countries. Medusa changes that scenario. How do you see the arrival of Medusa changing the digital environment for North Africa, and what are the challenges you have faced in this ambitious objective?
Medusa is a cable for an entire generation for North Africa countries. By providing direct, high-capacity connectivity to every country in the region, we are unlocking unprecedented opportunities for digital transformation. It will improve internet performance, lower costs, and create a more resilient regional network that benefits businesses, governments, and educational institutions alike.
One of the biggest impacts will be on the NRENs, which will now have long-term, secure, and scalable connectivity to European and global research communities. This is crucial for innovation, collaboration, and economic growth in the region.
Of course, a project of this scale comes with challenges. Regulatory approvals and the logistical execution of a multi-country, multi-partner initiative required careful coordination. However, our partnerships with governments, regulators, and financial institutions have helped us navigate these challenges successfully.
Medusa for North Africa will be completed in 2026. Do you have any additional plans for new submarine cable projects that you can share with us?
Yes, while our immediate focus remains on the successful deployment of Medusa in the Mediterranean, we are already expanding our vision beyond that. We recently announced the extension of Medusa to West Africa, a significant step made possible through a grant from the European Commission under the Connecting Europe Facility program. This expansion will further strengthen digital connectivity between Africa and Europe, supporting economic growth and innovation across the region.
Our long-term goal is to create a resilient and inclusive digital infrastructure that bridges continents and empowers communities.
Finally, with the first cable landings due to arrive later this year, how to you intend to celebrate these crucial milestones?
The first landings of Medusa will be a major milestone, not just for us but for the entire ecosystem of partners and stakeholders who have contributed to making this vision a reality. To mark this historic moment, we will invite all key stakeholders to witness the landing of the cable as it happens.
The EUMEDplus project is closely linked to the Medusa submarine cable initiative, serving as a strategic enabler that ensures the cable’s benefits reach research and education communities across North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. While Medusa provides the physical infrastructure—8.760 km high-capacity optical fibre cable connecting both shores of the Mediterranean Sea—EUMEDplus focuses on enhancing the capabilities of the NRENs in the region to effectively utilize this infrastructure. This includes developing national strategies for connectivity, improving operational efficiency, and ensuring long-term sustainability. Additionally, EUMEDplus aims to extend the reach of Medusa by exploring its expansion towards the Levant, thereby strengthening international research and education collaboration in the region.
